This allows you to grab all the main 
iptv streams around the net with the main tv guide also for them all.. all in 1 file.<br>
<br>
Theres an all in one that has all the streams in 1 m3u8 for easy adding to your fav player.<br>
https://github.com/bitsbb01/m3u8_creator/raw/main/Compiled-all-UpdatedStreams.m3u8<br>
<br>
If you want to download each 1 seperate, then look in the m3u8 folder.<br>
<br>
all these links auto update every 2hrs. (Used to be 3hrs)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The main thing comes from using a seperate git that pulls all the streams from 
Cat, and compiles into a .json, then its imported here and then converted to 
m3u8, m3u8_creaor also then pulls other m3u8's from around the net and will then 
assign the epg id's to them all and then compile into one, it also grabs the epg 
for all of them and stores that in folder EPG.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Free2View TV courtesy of the @Frugal_Streamer & Free2View TV Project and its team of developers: https://discord.gg/C48WhSTpw7 (Will be monitoring this, as has a lot of lists from other sources in this. so maybe removing this in future. EG. Pluto TV, TVS, Xumo and others. it also doesnt seem to be upto date with the new links for pluto, Roku etc, as those from the other sources are daily updates.) <br><br>
Also thanks go out to everyone else that has been able to help with designing 
and building all the various scripts to get this working. <br>
<br>
<br>IF YOU WANT A PLAYLIST ADDED, THEN PLEASE OPEN A DISCUSSION WITH THE LINK AND I'LL ADD IT INTO THE COMPILED VERSION FOR YOU.

<br>Still working on a link tester, mainly for all the other m3u8's from other sources.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>So added in some new scripts, however not having much luck getting them working today.

<br>    
<br>
<br>
3/01/2022<br>
Added back in Northern America, Europe, South America, Asia back in from IPTV Cat, as that was having issues for a few weeks, and had to change the way it worked.. now it's grabbing the files, but instead of 1 big file, its doing in in 5 smaller sections.. but don't worry its all there now.. <br>
Free2View TV is back in, hopefully it shouldnt show all there main things in the begining of the playlist under channels now, i know that was causing issues as it kept showing up in tivimate and kodi.<br>
It would really help if they had a playlist that didnt have all that section, eg. 

<br>   #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="" tvg-logo="https://od.lk/s/MF8yNDM1NjI1MDhf/F2V-TV_light_701x701.png" group-title="Samsung TV Plus",** MAJOR PLAYLIST UPDATE | See INFO category for details of changes to some source URLs including EPG (12/11/21) **
    
<br>
    what it does, is on normal tivimate, you cant see anything about tv channel as all u see is ding EPG (12/11/21) **
    
<br>
    I understand this causes issues, and thats not something i can fix, i tried doing code that would clean it up, but as they've got it where the channel name is, the code cannot see it and therefore cannot clean up... 
    
<br>
    if it still causes issue's, I may have to remove the Free2View completly.
