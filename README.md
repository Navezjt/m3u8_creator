This allows you to grab all the main iptv streams around the net with the main tv guide also for them all.. 

Theres an all in one that has all the streams in 1 m3u8 for easy adding to your fav player.
https://github.com/bitsbb01/m3u8_creator/raw/main/Compiled-all-Streams.m3u8

If you want to download each 1 seperate, then look in the m3u8 folder.

all these links auto update every 3hrs. 



The main thing comes from using a seperate git that pulls all the streams from Cat, and compiles into a .json, then its imported here and then converted to m3u8, m3u8_creaor also then pulls other m3u8's from around the net and will then assign the epg id's to them all and then compile into one, it also grabs the epg for all of them and stores that in folder EPG.


I can also set it up to grab other iptv's, but so far it seems to be very good... 
I'm looking at trying to also get all the streams from vaughn.live into a m3u8, but due to the streaming in flv, it makes it hard, unless i use streamlink to convert the stream, however not played around with that much..
