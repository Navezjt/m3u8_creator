<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00">This allows you to grab all the main 
iptv streams around the net with the main tv guide also for them all.. <br>
<br>
Theres an all in one that has all the streams in 1 m3u8 for easy adding to your 
fav player.<br>
https://github.com/bitsbb01/m3u8_creator/raw/main/Compiled-all-Streams.m3u8<br>
<br>
If you want to download each 1 seperate, then look in the m3u8 folder.<br>
<br>
all these links auto update every 3hrs. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The main thing comes from using a seperate git that pulls all the streams from 
Cat, and compiles into a .json, then its imported here and then converted to 
m3u8, m3u8_creaor also then pulls other m3u8's from around the net and will then 
assign the epg id's to them all and then compile into one, it also grabs the epg 
for all of them and stores that in folder EPG.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can also set it up to grab other iptv's, but so far it seems to be very 
good... <br>
I'm looking at trying to also get all the streams from vaughn.live into a m3u8, 
but due to the streaming in flv, it makes it hard, unless i use streamlink to 
convert the stream, however not played around with that much..<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to ericziethen for his help with the m3u8_creator.. <br>
Thanks go out to Sphinxroot for his really well done playlists..<br>
Thanks go out to junguler for his music playlists..<br>
Thanks go out to apsattv.com for there guys being able to get a lot of updated 
playlists..<br>
Thanks go out to matthuisman for his pbs playlist..<br>
Thanks go out to iptv-org for the us-vizio playlist..<br>
Once can get the free2view playlist to commpile into the main list correctly, 
then will re-add<br>
Free2View TV courtesy of the Free2View TV Project and its team of developers: 
https://discord.gg/C48WhSTpw7 <br>
Also thanks go out to everyone else that has been able to help with designing 
and building all the various scripts to get this working. <br>
<br>
<br>
Theres been lots of updates to the code, so now it deletes if the files are in 
folders, then run otherwise if the files are not there, then it'll skip that 
step and continue the main..<br>
<br>
Added back in Northern America, Europe, South America, Asia back in from IPTV Cat, as that was having issues for a few weeks, and had to change the way it worked.. now it's grabbing the files, but instead of 1 big file, its doing in in 5 smaller sections.. but don't worry its all there now.. <br>
Free2View TV is back in, hopefully it shouldnt show all there main things in the begining of the playlist under channels now, i know that was causing issues as it kept showing up in tivimate and kodi.<br>
It would really help if they had a playlist that didnt have all that section, eg. 

<br>   #EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="" tvg-logo="https://od.lk/s/MF8yNDM1NjI1MDhf/F2V-TV_light_701x701.png" group-title="Samsung TV Plus",** MAJOR PLAYLIST UPDATE | See INFO category for details of changes to some source URLs including EPG (12/11/21) **
    
<br>
    what it does, is on normal tivimate, you cant see anything about tv channel as all u see is ding EPG (12/11/21) **
    
<br>
    I understand this causes issues, and thats not something i can fix, i tried doing code that would clean it up, but as they've got it where the channel name is, the code cannot see it and therefore cannot clean up... 
    
<br>
    if it still causes issue's, I may have to remove the Free2View completly.
